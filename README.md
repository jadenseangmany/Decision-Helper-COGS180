# LINK TO PROTOTYPE
https://decision-helper-cogs-180.vercel.app/
### Info
This is just a prototype, so it has a full LLM backend without any theory supported decision making strategies. This could be a potential research area, where we can ask the question: "Can LLMs make better decisions than humans?" But for now, the goal of our project is to utilize bayesian decision making theory, so we want to see how we can link the algorithm to these LLM generated questions. If the full LLM backend is deemed interesting enough, maybe we can also use this to compare to bayesian models and see how the LLM performs--that might be pretty interesting. Please let us know if you have any questions!
